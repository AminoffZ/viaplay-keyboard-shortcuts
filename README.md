# Viaplay Keyboard Shortcuts (Chrome Extension)

![](project-logo-viaplay-shortcuts.png)

Viaplay is a streaming service with one annoying feature: it doesn't support using `m` key to mute nor `f` key to toggle fullscreen like almost any other player in the web these days. The player also doesn't support skipping the intro/recap wtih `s` or quickstarting the next episode with `n`.

I built this unpacked (at least until I can fix all the issues) Chrome extension to solve that problem.

(PS. I also built [one for Telia TV](https://github.com/Hamatti/teliatv-keyboard-shortcuts))

## How to use?

It's currently an unpacked extension so download and unzip it into a folder. Then open your Google Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable Developer mode from the toggle and select "Load unpacked" and navigate to the folder you unzipped it into.

Now whenever you navigate to [viaplay.fi](https://viaplay.fi) and start playing a video, the new keyboard shortcuts will be available.
