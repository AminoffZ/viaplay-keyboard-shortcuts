# Viaplay Keyboard Shortcuts (Chrome Extension)

Viaplay is a streaming service with one annoying feature: it doesn't support using `m` key to mute nor `f` key to toggle fullscreen like almost any other player in the web these days.

I built this unpacked (at least until I can fix all the issues) Chrome extension to solve that problem.

## Known issues

Using `m`/`f` works but not quite as intended. If your mouse is not over the control panel, it will also pause the video. I guess this happens because clicking on top of the video normally pauses and I haven't yet been able to figure out a way to circumvent that. It's still a major improvement to my flow so I started to use this already.

## How to use?

It's currently an unpacked extension so [download this](https://github.com/Hamatti/viaplay-keyboard-shortcuts/archive/master.zip) and unzip it into a folder. Then open your Google Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable Developer mode from the toggle and select "Load unpacked" and navigate to the folder you unzipped it into.

Now whenever you navigate to [viaplay.fi](https://viaplay.fi) and start playing a video, the new keyboard shortcuts will be available.
